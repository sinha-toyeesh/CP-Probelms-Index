##Basic Description##

You are given an array of integers(generally), you are given a fixed length(of the subarray) and a fixed sum(of all members of the subarray) to check for(condition)

Can be many variations , depends on wether ##contiguous## is mentioned(?)

##If contiguous is mentioned ?##

#Simplest method#

Use two loops to iterate through the list/array and check sum of the subaary specifically

Time Complexity : O(n^2) 

#Better Approach#

While taking input store values such that ith element of the array has the sum of all i elements that came before it.

Hence, if n(length of array) >= m(specified length of subarray) and (m-1) == d(specified sum of the memebrs of the subarray)
then, we get to check the first m elements instantly and decide the output.

After this, we iteratre through the mth elemnt to the nth element, while checking if (ith element - (i-m)the element() is equal to d.

Time Complexity : O(n)
